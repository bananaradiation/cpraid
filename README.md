##CPR AID for Google Glass
CPR AID utilizes multiple sensors within Google Glass to detect for proper CPR techniques. Specifically it keeps track of the number of compressions performed on a victim, calculates the compression rate and provides dynamic feedback on whether to speed up or slow down compressions. Within the app, you will also find pictoral instructions on how to properly administer CPR to adults. CPR AID is intended for both trainees and rescuers.

*We want to emphasize that CPR AID is currently in its prototype stages and is not a medically approved application. Be sure to call 911 before handling a victim.*

### Motivation

We spoke with medical professionals at VA San Diego Hospital to identify areas of improvement within a health/hospital domain. From this discussion and our research into Glass sensors, we narrowed our idea down to a tool that can be used to detect and assist in proper CPR administration, according to [BLS Guidelines](http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf). CPR is given to people who are unconscious and not breathing normally. According to the American Heart Association, nearly 383,000 out of hospital sudden cardiac arrests occur annually, with 88% occuring at home. Many individuals who first learn CPR are not comfortable with the force and technique required for proper CPR. For adults, a proper compression involves pushing down *at least* two inches; it is normal to break ribs during compressions.

Major factors motivating our work included: existing products in this space, plausibility of development given short timeline, contribution to the health field, Glass sensor capabilities, and the inherent nature of Google Glass (i.e. wearable, lightweight, quick to access). 

Current CPR devices in the market provide an alternative to manual CPR (see LUCAS Chest Compression System, LifeBelt CPR, ResQPump) in the form of a mechanical object. CPR AID is a sensor intended for manual CPR and does not compete with these hospital-approved devices. The closest existing solution is [PocketCPR](http://www.pocketcpr.com) created by Bio-Detek Inc. While PocketCPR is also a small physical device to be placed on a victim, they sell an app for iPhone and Android that offers the same functionality. 

###Potential Add-on Features
- Fine tune thresholds
- Track breath administration
- Sound notification for compression/breath switch
- Dynamic count rotating dialer
- Metronome to help set compression pace (to be turned on/off)
- Full swipe (fwd/back) functionality
- Calculation of depth of compression with appropriate user feedback

#### Interesting CPR Facts (via [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org))
- Longest successful CPR save: 96 minutes
- 100 compressions/minute ~ beat to "Stayin' Alive"
- 165 calories burned in 15 minutes of CPR training
- CPR certification is valid for 2 years, but skills are forgotten as early as 3 months after training
- Proper CPR can triple a person's chance of survival
